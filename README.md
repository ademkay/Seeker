# Seeker
Primitive email address finder for Linux.

1. Find your 'torrc' file in the Tor directory and add the following:
	ControlPort 9051
	CookieAuthentication 1
2. Write the path to your Tor launcher as here:
	/home/kali/tor-browser/start-tor-browser.desktop
3. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
4. Run seeker.py WITHOUT 'sudo' (python3 seeker.py). Follow the instructions: wait until the browser starts and connects.
5. I'm still working on bypassing search engine ban for too many requests, if the script gives 0 results - use after 1-2 hours.
6. FOR LEGAL USE ONLY. Anything else - on your own risk.

Tested on Kali Linux.
Requires Python3 and Tor browser.

Contact me if you meet any errors, I'll be thankful.

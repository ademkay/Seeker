# Seeker
Email address finder with result saving to .txt file. Need some help with testing and development, so if you can (and want) - contact me on mail.
Added Google API search function. Added search mode switching to menu. Commented unfinished options.

1. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
2. Run seeker.py. Read the instructions carefully.
   
Tested on Kali Linux and Windows 10.
Requires Python3.
Script doesn't bypass search engine ban for too many requests. If this happens - wait for 1-2 hours.
Options '2' and '3' require SMTP server address and e-mail address for test letter sending.
Tried public SMTP servers: Gmail, Outlook, Zohomail and got banned for spam sending, so these options weren't test properly.

Contact me if you meet any errors, I'll be thankful.

# Seeker
! Added DuckDuckGo search. Choose 'Switch search mode' to set.
Email address finder with result saving to .txt file. Need some help with testing and development, so if you can (and want) - contact me on mail.
Added Google API search function (https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview). Added search mode switching to menu. Commented unfinished options. Added .exe file for running not depending on Python.

1. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
2. If you have ones - paste your Google API key and SE ID into referred .txt files.
3. Run seeker.py. Read the instructions carefully.
   
Tested on Kali Linux and Windows 10.
Requires Python3.

Or:

1. If you have ones - enter your Google API key and SE ID into referred .txt files.
2. Run seeker.exe.

Tested on Windows 10.

Script doesn't bypass search engine ban for too many requests. If this happens - wait for 1-2 hours.
Options '2' and '3' require SMTP server address and e-mail address for test letter sending.
Tried public SMTP servers: Gmail, Outlook, Zohomail and got banned for spam sending, so these options weren't test properly.

Contact me if you meet any errors or have any ideas, I'll be thankful.

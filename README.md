# Seeker
Email address finder with result saving to .txt file. Totally updated, replaced old failed options, added new ones. Need some help with testing and development, so if you can (and want) - contact me on mail.

1. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
2. Run seeker.py (python3 seeker.py). Read the instructions carefully.
3. Script doesn't bypass search engine ban for too many requests. If this happens - wait for 1-2 hours.
4. FOR LEGAL USE ONLY. Anything else - on your own risk.

Tested on Kali Linux and Windows 10.
Requires Python3.
Options '2' and '3' require SMTP server address and e-mail address for test letter sending.
Tried public SMTP servers: Gmail, Outlook, Zohomail and got banned for spam sending, so these options weren't test properly.

Contact me if you meet any errors, I'll be thankful.
